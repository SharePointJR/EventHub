## event-hub

Event-hub is a simple web part that was built for a demo.  It demonstrates basic React and Redux concepts.
I walk through some of the details on https://sharepointlessons.wordpress.com/2019/03/18/building-an-app-with-spfx-react-and-typescript-part-1-stateless-functional-components/

### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
npm i
npm i -g gulp
gulp
```

This package produces the following:

* lib/* - intermediate-stage commonjs build artifacts
* dist/* - the bundled script, along with other resources
* deploy/* - all resources which should be uploaded to a CDN.

### Build options

gulp clean - TODO
gulp test - TODO
gulp serve - TODO
gulp bundle - TODO
gulp package-solution - TODO
